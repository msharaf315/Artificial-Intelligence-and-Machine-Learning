# Intelligence-and-Learning

This is a repository where I will keep all my projects for the intelligence and Learning course by Daniel Shiffman where I will learn about AI, Machine learning and Deep learning using java script with ml5, TenserFlow.js and p5.js libraries

# Travelling sales person

in this project I approached the travelling sales person problem using genetic algorithm.
using a DNA of different order of visiting the cities and calculating the fitness to accelerate the search.
the reproduction technique is a picking a random part of one of the population and mixing it with a part
from another order picked randomly according to their fitness.
