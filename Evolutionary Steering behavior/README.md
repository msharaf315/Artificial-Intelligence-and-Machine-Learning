# Intelligence-and-Learning

This is a repository where I will keep all my projects for the intelligence and Learning course by Daniel Shiffman where I will learn about AI, Machine learning and Deep learning using java script with ml5, TenserFlow.js and p5.js libraries

# Evolutionary Steering Behavior

in this project I create a population of vehicles that gradually die over time
and are either attracted to poison or food which reduces their health or increases it respectively.
the longer they survive the higher the chance that they reproduce creating a copy of their dna with a slight mutation
