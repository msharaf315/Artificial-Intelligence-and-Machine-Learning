# Intelligence-and-Learning

This is a repository where I will keep all my projects for the intelligence and Learning course by Daniel Shiffman where I will learn about AI, Machine learning and Deep learning using java script with ml5, TenserFlow.js and p5.js libraries

# K nearest neighbour recommendation system

In this project I learn about regression by using K nearest neighbour to calculate rating prediction of a movie that a user have not seen by calculating
the average rating of that movie from people who rated other movies the same way that particular user rated the same other movies
