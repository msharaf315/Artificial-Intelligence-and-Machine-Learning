Kevin bacon has been in so many movies that any actor has been in a movie with someone who has been in a movie with kevin bacon or has been with someone else who has been in a movie with Kevin Bacon (well this goes on for six more times) you can check it out yourself on https://oracleofbacon.org/.
But the point here is to create a network of nodes made of movies and actors and connect them together, then implement a breadth first search algorithm to mimic the search engine of the website using a dummy data.
